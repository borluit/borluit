## ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to get your website live on GitHub Pages.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1.  Create a new public repository on GitHub. Name it `your-username.github.io` if you want the site to be at `https://your-username.github.io`. Otherwise, you can name it anything (e.g., `borluit-portfolio`), and it will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/borluit-portfolio`.

### Step 2: Upload Files

1.  Download all the files provided (`index.html`, `apps.html`, etc.).
2.  Create an `assets` folder and place a `favicon.ico` file inside. You can generate one from many free online tools.
3.  Upload all the files and the `assets` folder to your new GitHub repository. Your file structure should look like this:

    ```
    /
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ apps.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ about.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ contact.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ privacy.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ disclaimer.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ sitemap.xml
    â”œâ”€â”€ robots.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ /assets/
        â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
    ```

### Step 3: Configure the Contact Form (Formspree)

1.  Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) and create a free account.
2.  Create a new form and point it to your email address (`kazirangaapps@gmail.com`).
3.  Formspree will give you a unique URL endpoint. It will look something like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`.
4.  Open `contact.html` and find the `<form>` tag. Replace the placeholder `action` URL with your unique Formspree URL:

    ```html
    <!-- BEFORE -->
    <form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id" method="POST">
    
    <!-- AFTER -->
    <form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx" method="POST"> 
    ```
5.  Save the `contact.html` file and commit the change to your repository.

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1.  In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
2.  Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.
3.  For the **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
4.  Click **Save**. GitHub will build and deploy your site. It might take a few minutes.
5.  Your website will be live at the URL shown on the GitHub Pages settings screen.

### Step 5: Update URLs and SEO Files

1.  **IMPORTANT:** Go through all `*.html` files, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` and replace every instance of `https://your-domain.com` with your actual live GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/borluit-portfolio`).
2.  Commit these changes to your repository.

### (Optional) Step 6: Custom Domain

1.  If you own a custom domain, you can connect it in the **Settings > Pages** section of your repository.
2.  Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to configure your DNS records with your domain registrar.
