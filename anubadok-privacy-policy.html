        <h1>Privacy Policy for Anubaadok - Assamese English Translator</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 15, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Anubaadok - Assamese English Translator ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of our mobile application, Anubaadok (the "App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
        <p>We are committed to user privacy. The App is designed to minimize data collection. Here is a breakdown of how data is handled for each feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Offline Dictionary & Bookmarks:</strong> The dictionary data is stored locally within the app. Any words you bookmark are saved in a local SQLite database on your device only. This information is not sent to us or any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>Add to Dictionary Feature:</strong> When you add a new word, it is saved to a file in the app's private internal storage on your device. This data is not transmitted off your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Form:</strong> If you use the "Contact Us" form, we collect the information you provide (name, email, contact number, and message) and store it securely in our Firebase Firestore database. We use this information solely to respond to your inquiries and improve our service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>To provide its core functionality, the App relies on several third-party services. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Web-Based Translation:</strong> The App uses a WebView to display third-party translation websites (Google Translate, Bing Translator, Bhashini). We do not control what data these websites collect when you interact with them.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advertising:</strong> The App uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized advertising and report on ad performance.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Play Services:</strong> The App uses Google Play Services for essential features like In-App Updates and In-App Reviews. These services may collect data as described in Google's Privacy Policy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
        <p>The App requests the following permissions for specific features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required for the WebView to load translation websites, to display ads, and to submit feedback through the contact form.</li>
            <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Required only when you choose to use the camera to upload an image for translation within the WebView. We do not access your camera or photos at any other time. The photos you take are sent directly to the translation service you are using and are not stored by our app.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
